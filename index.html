<h1>Places to Cry on Campus!</h1>
<hr>
<h2>The Back of the Campus Connector</h2>
<p>There is no greater feeling than getting on a Campus Connector in the winter, just after sunset. The
    bus is mostly empty, the lights are on and the bus is just warm enough that you can slip off your pair
    of gloves to shuffle a Spotify playlist and stare dreamily out the window. It is in these moments of
    peace that members of the student body can feel safe... safe enough to cry. <br> <p>

    Many generations of college students have taken a break in the connector to feel the feels, as the saying goes. At this
    point, crying in the back of a campus connector is a rite of passage for any hopeful graduate.
